# The WoW client protocol (world-socket header cipher) and Warden anti-cheat
# module protocol both mandate RC4. There is no way to replace RC4 with a
# stronger algorithm without breaking compatibility with all supported servers.
# All RC4 uses in this codebase are protocol-layer obligations, not choices.
# Exclude the weak-crypto query rather than leaving unfixable high-severity
# alerts that mislead triage.
