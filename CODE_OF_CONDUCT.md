# WOWEE Code of Conduct

WOWEE (World Of Warcraft Engine Experiment) is an engine development and research project.
We are building infrastructure, not exploits.

To keep this community productive, welcoming, and legally sound, we ask all members to follow these guidelines.

---

## 1. Be Respectful

- Treat everyone with respect.
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Debate ideas — not people.
- Technical disagreement is expected. Toxic behavior is not.

---

## 2. Stay On Topic

This server focuses on:
- Engine architecture
- Rendering systems
- Networking & protocol research
- Asset format analysis
- Performance engineering
- Multi-expansion compatibility

This is NOT a private server support hub.
This is NOT a place to distribute proprietary content.

---

## 3. No Piracy or Illegal Distribution

Absolutely prohibited:
- Sharing Blizzard client files
- Sharing MPQs or CASC archives
- Distributing proprietary assets
- Linking to pirated materials

Discussion of formats and reverse engineering concepts is allowed.
Distribution of copyrighted assets is not.

---

## 4. No Exploit Development

WOWEE is not:
- A cheat client
- A bot framework
- A bypass toolkit
- A Warden circumvention service

We are building a clean-room engine.

Discussion of protocol behavior and implementation details is allowed.
Discussion of active exploitation or abuse is not.

---

## 5. Technical Standards

We value:
- Evidence-based discussion
- Logs over speculation
- Reproducible testing
- Clear documentation

If you're reporting a bug:
- Include logs
- Include expansion/version
- Include reproduction steps

---

## 6. Collaboration Principles

- Credit contributors.
- Do not claim work that isn’t yours.
- If you fork, respect licensing terms.
- Keep discussions constructive and solution-focused.

---

## 7. Enforcement

Moderators may:
- Remove messages
- Issue warnings
- Mute users
- Ban repeat offenders

We prefer conversation over punishment — but we will protect the integrity of the project.

---

## 8. The Goal

WOWEE exists to:

• Modernize a legacy engine architecture  
• Preserve compatibility across expansions  
• Build a stable, high-performance client  
• Create a long-term alternative engine ecosystem  

If that excites you — welcome.

If you're here for shortcuts, exploits, or drama — this is not the place.

---

Build with integrity.
